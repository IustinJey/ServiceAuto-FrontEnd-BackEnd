# Service Auto - Fullstack Web Application

The project is a web application that allows users to manage car inventory, client information, and transactions related to the repairing of cars.
On the backend, the Django web framework was used with Python, and on the frontend, the Angular framework was used with TypeScript.
Together, the Django and Angular technologies provide a robust and scalable solution for managing car inventory and transactions in a web-based environment. Users can add, update, and delete cars, clients, and transactions. For the database I used MySQL Lite.

# Technologies Used:
- Django with Python
- Angular with TypeScript
- MySQL Lite
